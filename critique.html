                    <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">HTML Structure</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="critique-1-information">
                    <h6>Question 1</h6>
                    <h5>Does the website use semantic HTML elements? (e.g. &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;article&gt;)?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Considering that CodeChum revolves around function, that being as a learning tool 
                        to enhance students’ programming skills, a majority if not all, of the website’s 
                        HTML structure is quite simple. A head, a body containing a multitude of divs, and 
                        most importantly, lots of JavaScript files. Again, this isn’t really unexpected for 
                        CodeChum which revolves around coding education, which ranges from learning about code, 
                        writing code, testing code, and giving us problems to solve about code. While it 
                        effectively uses header text (h1 - h6)  tags and interactive elements, it lacks 
                        semantic HTML elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;article&gt;, which are crucial 
                        for improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO)
                        <br> <br>
                        Another thing to note upon inspecting the website’s source code is that it was 
                        developed using Python. This aligns with observations wherein error messages on the 
                        CodeChum terminal often show Python syntax. Overall, CodeChum's HTML structure is 
                        notably simple, primarily using sections and divs along with header tags (h1 - h6), 
                        links (&lt;a&gt;), and buttons.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="critique-1-information">
                    <h6>Question 2</h6>
                    <h5>Is the HTML code well-organized, with proper nesting and indentation?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Yes, in terms of the indentation least. As mentioned, CodeChum relies heavily on 
                        divs, which makes it hard to see which sections they represent. The lack of clear 
                        descriptions for elements like headers, footers, and articles adds to the confusion 
                        in the HTML structure. Although the overall layout is smooth, the unclear class names
                        and missing semantic HTML can be daunting for those looking at the code, especially 
                        since the script and styling files are also part of the HTML.
                    </p>

                <div class="critique-1-information">
                    <h6>Question 3</h6>
                    <h5>Are there any missing elements that could improve the structure (e.g., &lt;headings&gt;, &lt;forms&gt;)?</h5>
                    <p>
                        With the website's simple and straightforward design, the robustness of its structure
                         has been thoroughly refined as it doesn't need any major elements to be applied for 
                         it to have better structure. The different elements of the website harmoniously work 
                         together to give its user the ease of access to its features;

                            Codechum’s layout is simple, clean, and well-organized, making it easy to look at.
                            The colors and fonts are consistent, which gives it a professional appearance. However,
                            the overall design feels basic and could be improved with more modern touches, like
                            adding shadows, gradients, or smooth animations to buttons and sections. Small visual
                            details like icons or transitions would make the site more visually appealing and engaging.

                            notable change is for mobile phones where the user profile settings are found normally

                            if opened on a mobile phone.  Additionally, even though it uses different @media to
                            correspond to other screen sizes, the changes aren't too noticeable as they only change
                            the layout and structures of their divs and sections when the screen sizes are altered and
                            not the sizes.

                            is pleasing to the eye while keeping its functionality. The chosen color scheme and font
                            also goes really well together as it portrays the “futuristic” look they are aiming for

                    <p>
                        Yes, codechum is easy to navigate because the menus are clear, and links take you to the
                        right place without confusion. It’s simple to find what you need, such as lessons or activities.
                        However, the website doesn’t always respond immediately, which can be frustrating for users. This
                        issue could be solved by improving the speed and performance of the site to make it more efficient
                        and user-friendly.

                    <p>The text on CodeChum is easy to read, with a clear font size, strong contrast between text and
                        background, and enough space between lines. It also offers a dark mode for better comfort in
                        low-light environments. The platform also follows the “13 web design best practices to improve UX
                        in 2024” like good design practices, using different fonts for content and menu items, adding bullet
                        points to make text easier to scan, and avoiding hard-to-read color combinations like red and black.
                        There is enough space around text and headings to keep the layout clean, and it uses clear, readable

                    <h4>Are interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) functional?</h4>

                        Yes, the interactive elements on CodeChum, such as buttons, links, and forms, are functional and
                        designed to enhance user experience. Buttons change color when hovered over, providing feedback that
                        an action will occur when clicked. Links are clearly distinguishable and direct users to the intended
                        destinations. Additionally, the platform follows “the 13 web design best practices to improve UX in
                        2024”, such as using recognizable icons for easier navigation, placing the logo at the top left or
                        center of the website with a link back to the homepage for easy access, and maintaining a user-friendly
                        layout that encourages interaction.
